Doubly Linked List (DLL) Implementation in JavaA clean, efficient implementation of a bidirectional linked list in Java. This project demonstrates core data structure concepts including node manipulation, iterative and recursive traversals, and dynamic memory management logic.🚀 FeaturesThis implementation covers all fundamental Doubly Linked List operations:Insertions: Add elements at the front, the end, or any specific index.Deletions: Remove elements from the start, the end, or a specific position.Traversals: * Forward traversal (Iterative & Recursive).Backward traversal (Iterative & Recursive).Bidirectional Linking: Each node maintains a reference to both its nextNode and prevNode.🛠️ Project StructureListNode: The blueprint for individual elements containing the integer value and pointers.DLLManager: The main class containing the logic for list manipulation and the main method for testing.📊 Time ComplexityOperationComplexityDescriptionInsert at Start$O(1)$Immediate update of head pointer.Insert at End$O(n)$Requires traversing to the last node.Insert at Index$O(n)$Requires traversing to the specific position.Delete Start$O(1)$Immediate update of head pointer.Delete End$O(n)$Requires finding the tail node.Search$O(n)$Linear scan required in worst case.
